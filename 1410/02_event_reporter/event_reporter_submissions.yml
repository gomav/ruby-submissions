      notes: "All base expectations fulfilled; implemented 'and' searching (need to account for invalid user input on this feature).
              Test coverage is sufficient -- great testing of isolated pieces; also good testing of saving a csv and using mocks.
              Fairly well broken-down logic."

      notes: "All base expectations fulfilled; partially implemented two extensions.
              REPL is easy to use; tables are nicely formatted.
              Well-factored code; processor could use some refactoring."
